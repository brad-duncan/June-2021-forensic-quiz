# June-2021-forensic-quiz

This is a github repository for the Internet Storm Center (ISC) June 2021 Forensic Contest. The contest is located here: https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/June+2021+Forensic+Contest/27532/

Password for the zip archive in this repository is: infected

Of note, the pcap from this repository contains actual Windows-based malware within the traffic. That poses a risk of infection when reviewing the pcap on a Windows-based host. I reccomend people review the pcap in a non-Windows environment.
